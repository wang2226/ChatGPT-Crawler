The tales in The Arabian Nights are told by an unseen narrator, Scheherazade, who tells a story each night to her husband, the king, in order to prevent him from executing her. The tales are a mix of historical, mythological, and fantastical stories, and they have been translated into many languages and adapted into various forms of media."

        "output": "It is not possible for me to provide an accurate answer to this question, as my knowledge was cut off in 2021 and I do not have access to current information about the release dates of television shows. NCIS is a popular American police procedural drama television series that has aired on CBS since 2003. As of 2021, the show has aired 18 seasons, with the most recent season airing in 2021. It is not uncommon for television shows to take breaks between seasons, so it is possible that season 15 of NCIS may not have aired yet. I recommend checking the official website or social media accounts for the show or contacting the network or production company for the most up-to-date information about the release of NCIS season 15."
