        "input": "What does the skull protect?",
        "output": "The skull is a bony structure that surrounds and protects the brain and the sensory organs in the head. It consists of several bones that are fused together and form a protective shell around the brain, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth."

        "input": "How are neurons in the brain connected?",
        "output": "Neurons in the brain are connected to each other through a network of specialized structures called synapses. A synapse is a small gap between two neurons that allows them to communicate with each other. When an action potential, or electrical signal, travels down the axon of one neuron, it triggers the release of chemical neurotransmitters from the presynaptic neuron into the synapse. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing changes in the electrical potential of the postsynaptic neuron and transmitting the signal across the synapse."

        "input": "Which of the following doesn't have a brain, starfish or human?",
        "output": "Starfish do not have a brain. The human body has a brain, which is a complex organ located within the skull. The brain is the control center of the body and is responsible for coordinating and controlling the body's functions. It receives and processes sensory information from the senses, such as touch, sight, sound, and taste, and is involved in higher cognitive functions, such as thinking, learning, and problem-solving."

        "input": "What pathway does the motor cortex transfer projections to the spinal chord?",
        "output": "The motor cortex is a region of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for controlling voluntary movement. It is located in the frontal lobes of the brain and is organized in a somatotopic manner, meaning that different areas of the motor cortex control different parts of the body. Projections from the motor cortex are transmitted to the spinal cord through a pathway called the corticospinal tract. The corticospinal tract is a group of axons that extends from the motor cortex down to the spinal cord and is responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the muscles. The corticospinal tract is divided into two pathways: the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract and the corticobulbar tract."

        "input": "What areas of the brain communicate to the primary motor cortex?",
        "output": "The primary motor cortex, also known as the primary motor area, is a region of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for controlling voluntary movement. It is located in the frontal lobes of the brain and is organized in a somatotopic manner, meaning that different areas of the motor cortex control different parts of the body. Several areas of the brain communicate with the primary motor cortex to control movement. Some of these areas include: Sensory areas: The primary somatosensory cortex, which is located in the parietal lobes of the brain, receives sensory information from the body and sends it to the primary motor cortex. This information is used to guide movement and adjust the intensity of the movement. Basal ganglia: The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical structures that are involved in the planning and execution of movement. They send signals to the primary motor cortex to initiate movement and provide feedback to adjust the movement. Cerebellum: The cerebellum is a small, dome-shaped structure located at the base of the brain that is responsible for balance and coordination. It sends signals to the primary motor cortex to adjust movement and fine-tune muscle control. Brainstem: The brainstem is the lower part of the brain that controls basic functions such as breathing and heart rate. It sends signals to the primary motor cortex to control reflexive movements, such as the reflexes that help us maintain balance and posture. Overall, the primary motor cortex receives input from several areas of the brain to control movement and coordinate the body's movements."

        "input": "What level of the brain controls walking?",
        "output": "Walking is a complex behavior that involves the coordination of multiple muscle groups and the integration of sensory information. The control of walking involves multiple levels of the brain, including the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex."

        "input": "Which of the following is not a stall tactic: motions to adjourn, requests for roll call, or attracting press and media attention?",
        "output": "Attracting press and media attention is not a stall tactic. A stall tactic is a tactic that is used to delay or obstruct the progress of a task or activity, often with the intention of achieving some other goal."

        "input": "Which of the following is not one of the purposes of obstruction: to limit the majority party's ability to govern, to offer policy alternatives or to attract press attention?",
        "output": "Attracting press attention is not one of the purposes of obstruction. Obstruction is a tactic that is used to block or delay the progress of a task or activity, often with the intention of achieving some other goal."

        "output": "The Catalans played a significant role in the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the conquest of the city of Barcelona in 801 and the subsequent expansion of Catalan power in the region. They were motivated by a variety of factors, including a desire to expand their territory, to defend against Muslim incursions, and to spread Christianity. The Catalans also had a long tradition of naval power and played a key role in the Christian naval campaigns against Muslim control of the Mediterranean."

A count was a nobleman who held a territory called a county, which was typically a large administrative division or region. The title of count was often hereditary, meaning that it was passed down from one generation to the next, and the count had certain privileges and responsibilities within his county."
